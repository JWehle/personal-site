Hi, I'm Jannett!

I'm a PCB designer who specializes in DCDC Converter design, power electronics, and analog circuit design. I also dabble in embedded systems and microcontroller programming, mostly in C, but sometimes in Python. I have experience working with ECAD software suites including, Mentor Graphics Xpedition and Layout, KiCAD, and Altium Designer.

I'm passionate about creative writing, digital artwork, video game development, and music production. I devote as much effort to these as my free time allows, which often intersects with my knack for electronics and robotics. 

This website exists as a portfolio for me to showcase these types of projects: board design, electrical and mechanical projects, video game development, creative writing, and the sorts. Check out my Youtube channel, [JannettW](https://www.youtube.com/@jannettw), for more in depth project videos, tutorials, and showcases.
