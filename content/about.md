Hi, I'm Jannett!

I'm a PCB designer who specializes in DCDC Converter design, power electronics, and analog circuit design. I also dabble in embedded systems and microcontroller programming, mostly in C but sometimes in Python. 

Creative writing, digital artwork, video game developement, and music production are hobbies of mine which I devote as much passion into as my free time allows, and these sometimes intersect with my knack for electronics and robotics. The ECAD software suites I am most competent in are Mentor Graphics Xpedition and Layout, KiCAD, and Altium Designer, in that order. 

This website exists as a portfolio for me to showcase these types of projects: board design, electrical and mechanical projects, video game development, creative writing, and the sorts. Check out my Youtube channel, [JannettW](https://www.youtube.com/@jannettw), for more in depth project videos, tutorials, and showcases.
